# Deliverable

### Introduction
This code challenge asks you to build a web application for a role-based authentication system.  You need to design and implement the front-end/UI, the back-end/API, and the database for this application.  This system will need to support user login using a conventional means of authentication (e.g. OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, etc.) along with a role-based permissions system consisting of a minimal set of roles (described further below).  You can use any mainstream Identity Provider (e.g. GitHub, Google, Facebook, Microsoft) or a email/password combination stored in the database.

## Technical Requirements

Solutions must be developed using technology and architectural patters that demonstrates modern best practices. The solution may leverage open source components. The solution must not include proprietary components.

Solutions must be deployed to a Docker container platform accessible to the Province (e.g.: OpenShift.io, Azure, Amazon Web Services, etc.). The solution must remain running and accessible from 5:00pm Thursday, November 14. until 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Monday, November 18.

Solutions must be re-deployable using an automated deployment tool (e.g.: Jenkins, Azure DevOps, etc.). Configuration files for that tool must be committed to the private repository (such that the evaluators can just run the deployment as is).

## User Stories
All of the following user stories must be completed. They may be completed in any order. 

**Assumptions**
- There are 3 different types of users who will use the system:
  - **Guest**: users who are not authenticated
  - **Contributor**: users who are authenticated with the `contributor` role
  - **Admin**: users who are authenticated with the `administrator` role

### #1
As a user, I want to register with the application as a **Contributor**

**Given** that I am a user
**And** Iâ€™m in the &quot;Sign Up&quot; page
**When** I specify my sign-in credentials via the available Identity Provider
**Then** a new Contributer profile is created in the system
**And** I am redirected to the &quot;Profile&quot; page where I can either verify the details retreived from the Identity Provider profile or specify them myself.

*Note: User details should at a minimum, consist of first name, last name, and email.*

### #2
As a user, I want to login as a **Contributer** or an **Admin**

**Given** that I am a user
**And** I am on the &quot;Login&quot;
**When** I enter my credentials correctly
**Then** I am logged into the system
**And** I am redirected to the &quot;User List&quot; page

### #3
As a **Contributer** or an **Admin**, I want to view a paged list of registered users

**Given** that I am an authenticated user (Contributer or Admin)
**And** I am on the &quot;Users List&quot; page
**When** I view the list of users that is more than 10 in length
**Then** I can view the first 10 users along with a &quot;See More&quot; button
**And** I can click on the &quot;See More&quot; button to view the next 10 users in the list

*Note: Each user in the list should include an email, role, and date registered for that user*

### #4
As an **Admin**, I want to view the details for a particular user

**Given** that I am an authenticated Admin user
**When** I am in the &quot;Users List&quot;
**Then** I should be able to select a user
**And** I am redirected to a &quot;User Details&quot; page
**And** I can view the details for that user

### #5
As an **Admin**, I want to edit the details for a particular user

**Given** that I am an authenticated Admin user
**When** I am in the &quot;Users List&quot;
**Then** I can select a user for editing
**And** I am redirected to a &quot;Edit User Details&quot; page
**And** I can edit the details for that user and save my changes

### #6
As an **Admin**, I want to delete a particular user profile from the system

**Given** that I am an authenticated Admin user
**When** I am in the &quot;Users List&quot;
**Then** I can select a user for deletion
**And** I am prompted for confirmation of deletion
**And** the user profile for that user is deleted from the list when I select &quot;OK&quot;

*Note: Deleting a user should remove their entire profile and require that user to re-register prior to signing back in*

### #7
As a **Contributor** or an **Admin**, I want to log out

**Given** that I am an authenticated Contributor or Admin user
**When** I select the &quot;Logout&quot; button
**Then** I will be logged out immediately
**And** I will be redirected to the &quot;Login&quot; page



## Additional Notes

* A non-authenticated user should only be able to view the &quot;Login&quot; page
* Note that security engineering is a portion of the evaluation criteria.  While no specific constraints have been prescribed, we are looking for best practices around security and privacy to be followed.
* The Admin account can be pre-specified.  That is, there is no requirement for Admin account sign-up or creation in this challenge and only Contributer account registration is required.
* Please handle alternative flows to the above user stories as required.  For example, in User Story #2, entering incorrect credentials should be handled in a graceful manner.


## Submission

1. Include all artifacts that are required to build and deploy the solution including code, Dockerfiles, other configuration files, etc.
2. Include all artifacts that would typically be included in the definition of done including demonstration of testing (unit testing is sufficient).
3. Include a README file with instructions to access the deployed solution and any instructions required to redeploy the solution.
4. Submit artifacts by way of a pull request to the private repository. All artifacts must be committed and a PR issued **before 5:00 p.m. Pacific time on Thursday, November 14, 2019**.
5. Attach an Apache License 2.0 to your pull request.
